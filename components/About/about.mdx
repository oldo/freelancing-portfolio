Since getting my first computer at the age of 6 (a Commodore 64 with cassette tape data storage ðŸ¤˜) I've always enjoyed using computers as a tool to get stuff done, but I transitioned into a fulltime career in software development **over 4 years ago** and since then I have been completely immersed in startup land as one of the first team members and eventual CTO of [Bookinglayer](https://www.bookinglayer.com) and then co-founder and CTO of [Bookex](https://www.usebookex.com) - both **very complex web and mobile applications** for accommodation and service providers to manage their inventory and reservations.

I am freshly dipping my big-toe into the world of freelancing, however I have worked with many different freelance developers in the past and so I understand what is required for a project based worker to be **productive** and stay on track **aligned with the companyâ€™s product vision.**
