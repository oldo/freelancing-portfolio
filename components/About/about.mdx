I am primarily a frontend developer and am increasingly putting energy into building my backend quiver of skills. I have **a very sharp attention to detail** and get my kicks out of creating web and mobile applications that **efficiently and intuitively solve the end-user's problem.** I believe that **code should be frequently shipped and iterated.**

Since getting my first computer at the age of 6 (a Commodore 64 with cassette tape data storage ðŸ¤˜) I've always enjoyed using computers as a tool to get stuff done. I transitioned into a fulltime career in software development **over 4 years ago** and since then I have been completely immersed in startup land as one of the first team members and eventual Tech Lead of [Bookinglayer](https://www.bookinglayer.com) and then co-founder and CTO/Lead Developer of [Bookex](https://www.usebookex.com) - both **very advanced web and mobile applications** for accommodation and service providers.

In addition to my experience as a software developer, I have a background as a mechancial engineer designing thermal power generation systems and as a marine engineer working on the operations and maintenance of intercontinental ships. As a result, **I have a unique profile that can bring something different to your team and project.**
