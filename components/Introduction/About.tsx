            Since getting my first computer at the age of 6 (a Commodore 64 with
            cassette tape data storage ðŸ¤˜) I've always enjoyed using computers
            as a tool to get stuff done, but I transitioned into a fulltime
            career in software development <strong>over 4 years ago</strong> and
            since then I have been completely immersed in startup land as one of
            the first team members and eventual CTO of Bookinglayer and then
            co-founder and CTO of Bookex - both{' '}
            <strong>very complex web and mobile applications</strong>{' '}
            for accommodation and service providers to manage their inventory
            and reservations.

            I am freshly dipping my big-toe into the world of freelancing,
            however I have worked with many different freelance developers in
            the past and so I understand what is required for a project based
            worker to be <strong>productive</strong> and stay on track{' '}
            <strong>aligned with the companyâ€™s product vision.</strong>
